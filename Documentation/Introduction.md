 Introduction (18/08/2025 â€“ 30/08/2025)

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

Every year, thousands of students appear for MHT-CET and JEE exams to get admission into engineering colleges in Maharashtra. However, students face many problems such as:

Difficulty in finding which colleges match their score and category.

Data about cut-offs, placements, and branch details is scattered across multiple websites.

No single platform that provides personalized recommendations.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
A student with a score of 95 percentile in MHT-CET wants Computer Science in Pune but doesnâ€™t know which colleges are possible and what placements are like.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives

To build a College Recommendation System for engineering colleges in Maharashtra.

To provide personalized suggestions based on score, category, location and branch preference.

To display important details such as category-wise cut-offs, branch-wise cuttoff, placement statistics, and quality of colleges.

To save studentsâ€™ time and effort by giving accurate, data-driven results in one platform.

ðŸ”¹ Applications of the Project

For Students â†’ Helps them choose the best college according to their profile.

For Parents â†’ Gives transparency about placements, and return on investment.

For Educational Counselors â†’ Assists in providing reliable, data-backed guidance.

For Researchers â†’ Useful dataset for studying admission patterns and cutoff trends.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
If a student inputs MHT-CET percentile = 88, Category = OBC, Branch = IT, Location = Mumbai, the system will recommend a list of colleges in Mumbai where admission is likely, along with branch wise cuttoff and placement info.
