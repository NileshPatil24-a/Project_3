Literature Survey (01/09/2025 – 13/09/2025)

🔹 Background

Currently, students use CET Cell PDFs, AICTE data, education portals like Shiksha, Careers360, and personal counseling to decide on colleges. These sources provide information but are not integrated or personalized.
Machine learning and recommendation systems can solve this problem by using data analysis + user preferences to suggest the best-fit colleges.


🔹 Existing Systems (Survey of 3–5 sources)

CET Cell Website

Provides official cut-off PDFs every year.

Limitation: Students must manually search across many pages.

Shiksha / Careers360 / CollegeDekho

Show college details, rankings, reviews.

Limitation: Many results are sponsored/promoted → not always unbiased.

AICTE Data Portal

Official details of institutes, intake, accreditation.

Limitation: Does not provide personalized admission chances.

Counseling Centers / Private Consultants

Provide one-to-one advice.

Limitation: Expensive, subjective, not scalable.

👉 Example:
If a student checks Careers360 and reviews but not actual MHT-CET cut-offs, while on the CET Cell site they see cut-offs but not placements.


🔹 Limitations of Existing Systems

Information is scattered across multiple sources.

Lack of AI/ML-based recommendations.

Students face confusion and delays in decision-making.

Information is fragmented (cutoffs in CET Cell, placements on websites).

No all-in-one platform combining cut-offs, placements, and location filters.

Most systems do not consider personal preferences like budget, branch, and location.

Counseling is biased or costly, while portals are often promotional.

No proper use of machine learning to provide personalized recommendations.
